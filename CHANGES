v2016.7-dev 2017-01-06
 - Add SPIR-V 1.2

    SPV_AMD_texture_gather_bias_lod
    SPV_AMD_gpu_shader_int16
 - Optimizer: Add support for:
   - Inline all function calls in entry points.
   - Flatten of decoration groups.  Fixes #602
   - Id compaction (minimize Id bound).  Fixes #624
   - Eliminate redundant composite insert followed by extract
   - Simplify access chains to local variables
   - Eliminate local variables with a single store, if possible
   - Eliminate loads and stores in same block to local variables
 - Assembler: Add option to preserve numeric ids. Fixes #625
 - Add build target spirv-tools-vimsyntax to generate spvasm.vim, a SPIR-V
   assembly syntax file for Vim.
 - Version string: Allow overriding of wall clock timestamp with contents
   of environment variable SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH.
 - Validator implements relaxed rules for SPV_KHR_16bit_storage.
 - CMake installation rules use GNUInstallDirs.  For example, libraries
   will be installed into a lib64 directory if that's the norm for the
   current system.
 - Fixes:
   #500: Parameterize validator limit checks
   #508: Support compilation under CYGWIN
   #517: Fix validation when continue (or case) contstruct is also the head of a
     nested control construct.
   #551: If a merge block is reachable, it must be *strictly* dominated by its
     header.
   #548: Validator: Error when the reserved OpImageSparseSampleProj* opcodes
     are used.
   #611: spvtools::Optimizer was failing to save the module to the output
     binary vector when all passes succeded without changes.
   #629: The inline-entry-points-all optimization could generate invalidly
     structured code when the inlined function had early returns.
   #697: Optimizer's Instruction::ForEachInId method was skipping semantics-id
     and scope-id.

   - Id bound check
 - Disasssembler:
   - Generates friendly GLSL-based names for more builtin variables

     binary on file load/save.

     by SPIR-V 1.0 Rev7, 1.1 Rev 3.
   #340: Avoid race on mkdir during build

         (variable,parent) parameters to OpPhi

         merge block

v2016.1 2016-07-19
 - Fix https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/issues/261
   Turn off ClipDistance and CullDistance capability checks for Vulkan.
 - The disassembler can emit friendly names based on debug info (OpName
   instructions), and will infer somewhat friendly names for most types.
   This is turned on by default for the spirv-dis command line tool.
 - Updated to support SPIR-V 1.1 rev 2
   - Input StorageClass, Sampled1D capability, and SampledBuffer capability
     do not require Shader capability anymore.

v2016.0 2016-07-04

 - Adds v<year>.<index> versioning, with "-dev" indicating
   work in progress.  The intent is to more easly report
   and summarize functionality when SPIRV-Tools is incorporated
   in downstream projects.

 - Summary of functionality (See the README.md for more):
   - Supports SPIR-V 1.1 Rev 1
   - Supports SPIR-V 1.0 Rev 5
   - Supports GLSL std450 extended instructions 1.0 Rev 3
   - Supports OpenCL extended instructions 1.0 Rev 2
   - Assembler, disassembler are complete
     - Supports floating point widths of 16, 32, 64 bits
     - Supports integer widths up to 64 bits
   - Validator is incomplete
     - Checks capability requirements in most cases
     - Checks module layout constraints
     - Checks ID use-definition ordering constraints,
       ignoring control flow
     - Checks some control flow graph rules
   - Optimizer is introduced, with few available transforms.
   - Supported on Linux, OSX, Android, Windows

 - Fixes bugs:
   - #143: OpenCL pow and pown arguments
