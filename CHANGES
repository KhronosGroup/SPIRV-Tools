Revision history for SPIRV-Tools

v2016.2-dev 2016-07-19
 - Start v2016.2
 - Validator is incomplete
   - Checks ID use block is dominated by definition block
 - Add optimization passes
   - Strip debug info instructions
   - Freeze spec constant to their default values

v2016.1 2016-07-19
 - Fix https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/issues/261
   Turn off ClipDistance and CullDistance capability checks for Vulkan.
 - The disassembler can emit friendly names based on debug info (OpName
   instructions), and will infer somewhat friendly names for most types.
   This is turned on by default for the spirv-dis command line tool.
 - Updated to support SPIR-V 1.1 rev 2
   - Input StorageClass, Sampled1D capability, and SampledBuffer capability
     do not require Shader capability anymore.

v2016.0 2016-07-04

 - Adds v<year>.<index> versioning, with "-dev" indicating
   work in progress.  The intent is to more easly report
   and summarize functionality when SPIRV-Tools is incorporated
   in downstream projects.

 - Summary of functionality (See the README.md for more):
   - Supports SPIR-V 1.1 Rev 1
   - Supports SPIR-V 1.0 Rev 5
   - Supports GLSL std450 extended instructions 1.0 Rev 3
   - Supports OpenCL extended instructions 1.0 Rev 2
   - Assembler, disassembler are complete
     - Supports floating point widths of 16, 32, 64 bits
     - Supports integer widths up to 64 bits
   - Validator is incomplete
     - Checks capability requirements in most cases
     - Checks module layout constraints
     - Checks ID use-definition ordering constraints,
       ignoring control flow
     - Checks some control flow graph rules
   - Optimizer is introduced, with few available transforms.
   - Supported on Linux, OSX, Android, Windows

 - Fixes bugs:
   - #143: OpenCL pow and pown arguments
