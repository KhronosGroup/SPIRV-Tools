// OpSpecConstantFalse instructions) and replaces them with their normal

// not handled, as these instructions indicate their value are not determined
// and can be changed in future. A spec constant is foldable if all of its
// value(s) can be determined from the module. E.g., an integer spec constant
// defined with OpSpecConstantOp instruction can be folded if its value won't
// change later. This pass will replace the original OpSpecContantOp instruction
// with an OpConstant instruction. When folding composite spec constants,
// new instructions may be inserted to define the components of the composite
// constant first, then the original spec constants will be replaced by
// OpConstantComposite instructions.

//  1) Constants defined by OpConstantNull instructions (null constants) and
//  constants defined by OpConstantFalse, OpConstant or OpConstantComposite
//  with value 0 (zero-valued normal constants) are not considered equivalent.
//  So null constants won't be used to replace zero-valued normal constants,
//  vice versa.
//  2) Whenever there are decorations to the constant's result id id, the
//  constant won't be handled, which means, it won't be used to replace any
//  other constants, neither can other constants replace it.
//  3) NaN in float point format with different bit patterns are not unified.

// This pass searches for blocks with a single Branch to a block with no

// blocks and Merge blocks are not candidates for the second block.
//
// The pass is most useful after Dead Branch Elimination, which can leave
// such sequences of blocks. Merging them makes subsequent passes more
// effective, such as single block local store-load elimination.
//
// While this pass reduces the number of occurrences of this sequence, at
// this time it does not guarantee all such sequences are eliminated.
//
// Presence of phi instructions can inhibit this optimization. Handling
// these is left for future improvements. 
Optimizer::PassToken CreateBlockMergePass();

// Creates an exhaustive inline pass.
// An inline pass attempts to exhaustively inline all function calls in
// all functions in an entry point call tree. The intent is to enable,
// albeit through brute force, analysis and optimization across function
// calls by subsequent optimization passes. As the inlining is exhaustive,
// there is no attempt to optimize for size or runtime performance. Functions
// that are not in the call tree of an entry point are not changed.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateInlineExhaustivePass();
  
// Creates an opaque inline pass.
// An inline pass inlines all function calls in all functions in an entry
// point call tree. The intent is to enable, albeit through brute force,
// analysis and optimization across these function calls by subsequent
// passes in order to remove the storing of opaque types which is not
// legal in Vulkan. Functions that are not in the call tree of an entry
// point are not changed.

// Creates a single-block local variable load/store elimination pass.
// For every entry point function, do single block memory optimization of 
// function variables referenced only with non-access-chain loads and stores.
// For each targeted variable load, if previous store to that variable in the
// block, replace the load's result id with the value id of the store.
// If previous load within the block, replace the current load's result id
// with the previous load's result id. In either case, delete the current
// load. Finally, check if any remaining stores are useless, and delete store
// and variable if possible.
//
// The presence of access chain references and function calls can inhibit
// the above optimization.
//
// Only modules with logical addressing are currently processed. 
//
// This pass is most effective if preceeded by Inlining and 
// LocalAccessChainConvert. This pass will reduce the work needed to be done
// by LocalSingleStoreElim and LocalMultiStoreElim.
//
// Only functions in the call tree of an entry point are processed.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateLocalSingleBlockLoadStoreElimPass();

// Create dead branch elimination pass.
// For each entry point function, this pass will look for SelectionMerge
// BranchConditionals with constant condition and convert to a Branch to
// the indicated label. It will delete resulting dead blocks.
//
// This pass only works on shaders (guaranteed to have structured control
// flow). Note that some such branches and blocks may be left to avoid
// creating invalid control flow. Improving this is left to future work.
//
// This pass is most effective when preceeded by passes which eliminate
// local loads and stores, effectively propagating constant values where
// possible.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateDeadBranchElimPass();

// Creates an SSA local variable load/store elimination pass.
// For every entry point function, eliminate all loads and stores of function
// scope variables only referenced with non-access-chain loads and stores.
// Eliminate the variables as well. 
//
// The presence of access chain references and function calls can inhibit
// the above optimization.
//
// Only shader modules with logical addressing are currently processed.
// Currently modules with any extensions enabled are not processed. This
// is left for future work.
//
// This pass is most effective if preceeded by Inlining and 
// LocalAccessChainConvert. LocalSingleStoreElim and LocalSingleBlockElim
// will reduce the work that this pass has to do.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateLocalMultiStoreElimPass();

// Creates a local access chain conversion pass.
// A local access chain conversion pass identifies all function scope
// variables which are accessed only with loads, stores and access chains
// with constant indices. It then converts all loads and stores of such
// variables into equivalent sequences of loads, stores, extracts and inserts.
//
// This pass only processes entry point functions. It currently only converts
// non-nested, non-ptr access chains. It does not process modules with
// non-32-bit integer types present. Optional memory access options on loads
// and stores are ignored as we are only processing function scope variables.
//
// This pass unifies access to these variables to a single mode and simplifies
// subsequent analysis and elimination of these variables along with their
// loads and stores allowing values to propagate to their points of use where
// possible.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateLocalAccessChainConvertPass();

// Create aggressive dead code elimination pass
// This pass eliminates unused code from functions. In addition,
// it detects and eliminates code which may have spurious uses but which do
// not contribute to the output of the function. The most common cause of
// such code sequences is summations in loops whose result is no longer used
// due to dead code elimination. This optimization has additional compile
// time cost over standard dead code elimination.
//
// This pass only processes entry point functions. It also only processes
// shaders with logical addressing. It currently will not process functions
// with function calls. It currently only supports the GLSL.std.450 extended
// instruction set. It currently does not support any extensions.
//
// This pass will be made more effective by first running passes that remove
// dead control flow and inlines function calls.
//
// This pass can be especially useful after running Local Access Chain
// Conversion, which tends to cause cycles of dead code to be left after
// Store/Load elimination passes are completed. These cycles cannot be
// eliminated with standard dead code elimination.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateAggressiveDCEPass();

// Creates a local single store elimination pass.
// For each entry point function, this pass eliminates loads and stores for 
// function scope variable that are stored to only once, where possible. Only
// whole variable loads and stores are eliminated; access-chain references are
// not optimized. Replace all loads of such variables with the value that is
// stored and eliminate any resulting dead code.
//
// Currently, the presence of access chains and function calls can inhibit this
// pass, however the Inlining and LocalAccessChainConvert passes can make it
// more effective. In additional, many non-load/store memory operations are
// not supported and will prohibit optimization of a function. Support of
// these operations are future work.
//
// This pass will reduce the work needed to be done by LocalSingleBlockElim
// and LocalMultiStoreElim and can improve the effectiveness of other passes
// such as DeadBranchElimination which depend on values for their analysis.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateLocalSingleStoreElimPass();

// Creates an insert/extract elimination pass.
// This pass processes each entry point function in the module, searching for
// extracts on a sequence of inserts. It further searches the sequence for an
// insert with indices identical to the extract. If such an insert can be
// found before hitting a conflicting insert, the extract's result id is
// replaced with the id of the values from the insert.
//
// Besides removing extracts this pass enables subsequent dead code elimination
// passes to delete the inserts. This pass performs best after access chains are
// converted to inserts and extracts and local loads and stores are eliminated.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateInsertExtractElimPass();

// Create dead branch elimination pass.
// For each entry point function, this pass will look for BranchConditionals
// with constant condition and convert to a branch. The BranchConditional must
// be preceeded by OpSelectionMerge. For all phi functions in merge block,
// replace all uses with the id corresponding to the living predecessor.
//
// This pass is most effective when preceeded by passes which eliminate
// local loads and stores, effectively propagating constant values where
// possible.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateDeadBranchElimPass();

// Creates a pass to consolidate uniform references.
// For each entry point function in the module, first change all constant index
// access chain loads into equivalent composite extracts. Then consolidate 
// identical uniform loads into one uniform load. Finally, consolidate
// identical uniform extracts into one uniform extract. This may require
// moving a load or extract to a point which dominates all uses.
//
// This pass requires a module to have structured control flow ie shader
// capability. It also requires logical addressing ie Addresses capability
// is not enabled. It also currently does not support any extensions.
//
// This pass currently only optimizes loads with a single index.
Optimizer::PassToken CreateCommonUniformElimPass();
