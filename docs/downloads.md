# Downloads

## Vulkan SDK

The official releases for SPIRV-Tools can be found on LunarG's
[SDK download page](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).
The Vulkan SDK is updated approximately every six weeks.

## Android NDK

SPIRV-Tools host executables, and library sources are published as
part of the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads).

## Automated builds

For convenience, here are also links to the latest builds (HEAD).
Those are untested automated builds. Those are not official releases, nor
are guaranteed to work. Official releases builds are in the Android NDK or
Vulkan SDK.

Download the latest builds of the [main](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/tree/main) branch.
